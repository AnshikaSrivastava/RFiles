Any vector arithmetic is performed in element by element fashion. So that means each element of vector v1 is mathematically operated on V2.
By our operator logic. But then we must ask ourselves what if length of one vector is less than / greater than other vector. Well simple then
the elements of smaller vectors will be repeated until all n elements of larger vector are satisfied.
> earnings <- c(20,50,98,89,56,13,64,64,97,63,4,33)

> speanding <- c(12,64,21,54,21,78,54,6,22,5,20,55)

> balance <- earnings - speanding

> balance
 [1]   8 -14  77  35  35 -65  10  58  75  58 -16 -22

> Total_balance = sum(balance)

> Total_balance
[1] 239
