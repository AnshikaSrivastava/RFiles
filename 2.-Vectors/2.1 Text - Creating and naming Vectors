Creating and naming Vectors

Properties of a Vector-
  - A vector is a sequence of elements of same atomic data data type
  - Example - character vectors, numeric vectors, logica vectors etc.
  
> # Creating a vector in R
> # - We use a c() function which allows us to combine all the values to create the vector
> 
> # Code below creates a character vectot of animals
> c("cat", "dog", "fish", "rat")
[1] "cat"  "dog"  "fish" "rat" 
> 
> # Ofcourse we can assign this vector to a variable
> animalsVector <- c("cat", "dog", "fish", "rat")
> 
> # now we can check the values of this vector by simply typing the name 
> animalsVector
[1] "cat"  "dog"  "fish" "rat" 
> 
> # We can additionally check if animalVector is indeed a vector
> is.vector(animalsVector)
[1] TRUE


creating a vector and assigning name/ labels to it's data elements

> crimes <- c(90,80,50,35)
> crimes
[1] 90 80 50 35
> #let's create a numeric vector with no. of crimes in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore
> #and Hyderabad
> crimes <- c(90,80,50,35)
> 
> crimes
[1] 90 80 50 35
> 
> #But crimes here isn't very intuitive. For say how do I know which number 
> #represent which city? so let's make another vector called cityVector
> 
> cityVector <- c("Delhi","Mumbai","Hyderabad","Bangalore")
> cityVector
[1] "Delhi"     "Mumbai"    "Hyderabad" "Bangalore"
> 
> #now let's assign cityVector to crimes so that appropriate resukts can be visualised
> names(crimes) <- cityVector
> crimes
    Delhi    Mumbai Hyderabad Bangalore 
       90        80        50        35 
  
  
  
  Assigning names to vectors while creation itself
> #instead of assignning name vectors separately what I can also so is to create everything 
> # together inside one vector. Exmaple?
> 
> cardVector <- c(king=4, queen = 3, joker = 4)
> cardVector
 king queen joker 
    4     3     4 
> 
> #same thing could be achieved by using double quested. Let's prefer double quote for names 
> # for the time being as it gives us exact differenctiation
> 
> cardVector2 <- c("spades"=13, "heart" = 12, "diamond" = 9)
> cardVector2
 spades   heart diamond 
     13      12       9 
     
     
     
REVISITING VARIABLES
What are variables exactly in R? R doesn't provide any distinction data structure to hold variables so in essence all variables are 
vectors of length 1.
